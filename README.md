# YPB Interface Documentation

Welcome to the **ypb-doc** repository—the official source for documentation and specifications of the YPB (*Yet another Pipeline Bus*) interface.

This repository is intended to centralize the living specification for YPB, supporting IP integration, validation tooling, and serving as the official reference for all project partners.  
Here you will find:
- Detailed specifications (`.adoc` – AsciiDoc)
- Annexes (timing diagrams, technical notes, etc.)
- Associated diagrams (WaveDrom-generated SVGs, and more)

All documentation is written in AsciiDoc for maximum portability—enabling easy rendering to HTML, PDF, or direct browsing within GitHub.
